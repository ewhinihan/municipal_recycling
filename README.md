This dataset and documentation provides an analysis on the recycling amounts, cost, and effectiveness for the recycling programs of Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, 
and Los Angeles, CA. The intended audience for this dataset are citizens who would like to be better informed about recycling effectiveness. 
It is freely available to the public.

The raw dataset is available in both .csv and .xlsx formats. The normalized dataset is in .xlsx file format.
A standard data normalization method was used to normalize the data that included parsing, standardization, cleaning, and enrichment. Rows and columns were 
aligned and formatted, numbers were made consistent using the same number of decimal places and "NA" when needed, and additional data was added to enhance
the data accessibility (population and area).

A data dictionary is included as an .xlsx file that provides further information on the variable constraints, description, and content.

The curation protocol document is a PDF file and provides an abstract/background and analysis on this dataset, the data collection process, sources, 
metadata schema, and personal reflection.
