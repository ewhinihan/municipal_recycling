This dataset and documentation provides an analysis on the recycling amounts, cost, and effectiveness for the recycling programs of Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, 
and Los Angeles, CA. The intended audience for this dataset are citizens who would like to be better informed about recycling effectiveness. 
It is freely available to the public.

The raw dataset is available in both .csv and .xlsx formats. The normalized dataset is in .xlsx file format.
A standard data normalizing convention was used to normalize the data to ensure numbers had the same number of decimal places, columns were aligned and 
spaced evenly, and blank spaces contained "NA".

The file naming convention for this dataset uses camelCase, no spacing, project title, and indication of what type of document it is:

municipalRecycling_Data_Raw
municipalRecycling_Data_Normal
municipalRecycling_Data_Dictionary

README.md

A data dictionary is included as an .xlsx file that provides further information on the variable constraints, description, and content.

The curation protocol document is a PDF file and provides an abstract/background and analysis on this dataset, the data collection process, sources, 
metadata schema, and personal reflection.
