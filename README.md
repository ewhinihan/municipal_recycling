# municipal_recycling
This dataset and documentation provides an analysis on the recycling amounts, cost, and effectiveness for the recycling programs of Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, and Los Angeles, CA. This data curation protocol was created for a Data Curation course at the iSchool at the University of Washington during the Winter Quarter of 2021. 
The intended audience for this dataset are citizens who would like to be better informed about recycling effectiveness. It is freely available to the public.

The raw dataset is available in both .csv and .xlsx formats. A data normalizing convention was used to normalize the data to ensure numbers had the same number of decimal places, columns were aligned and spaced evenly, and blank spaces contained "NA". The normalized dataset had to be saved .xlsx file so formatting changes would be retained.

The file naming convention for this dataset uses camelCase, no spacing, and indication of what type of document it is:

municipalRecycling_Data_Raw

municipalRecycling_Data_Normal

municipalRecycling_Data_Dictionary

whinihanErika_Curation_Protocol_030821

A data dictionary is included as an .xlsx file that provides further information on the variable constraints, description, and content.

The curation protocol document is a PDF file and provides an abstract/background and analysis on this dataset, the data collection process/sources, metadata schema, and personal reflection.
